# Pacheesi Game

## About

Pachisi is a classic Indian board game, often called the ‚Äúnational game of India.‚Äù üé≤ It involves moving pieces around a cross-shaped board based on dice rolls, with the ultimate goal of getting all your pieces to the center home area before your opponents do. 

The game allows players to capture each other‚Äôs pieces, adding a strategic twist, while safe spaces on the board protect pawns from being captured. The game is deeply rooted in Indian culture, even being mentioned in the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata üìú. Pachisi has inspired modern games like **Parcheesi** and **Ludo**, which have spread worldwide üåç.

Whether played casually or competitively, Pachisi remains a beloved game that brings people together! üòä

## Game Rules Recap

### Basic Rules

- **Dice Roll**: The dice are rolled by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. The dice rolls dictate your move.
- **Moving Pawns**: Select one die value and click on your pawn to move it that number of spaces forward. You can move multiple pawns, but each one can only move based on the dice roll.
- **Capturing**: If your pawn lands on an opponent's pawn (except on the start position), you capture their pawn and send it back to the start. You also get an additional bonus roll.
- **Winning**: The first player to move all four of their pawns to the center "home" area wins!

### Bonus Features
- **Matching Dice**: When you roll matching dice (e.g., double 6), you receive a bonus throw.
- **Safe Spaces**: Certain spaces on the board are designated as safe, where pawns cannot be captured by opponents.
